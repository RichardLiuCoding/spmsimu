# spmsimu -- Simulator of Scanning Probe Microscopy

Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) simulator based on Python.

It simulates realistic SPM scans based on ground-truth patterns or user-input images. This simulator emulates effects of most of controlling parameters so it can be used as a training tool for new SPM operators.

It also serves as a playground for testing machine learning based automation algorithms as the results can be validated through real SPM experiments.
